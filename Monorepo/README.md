## Monorepo with Next.js and Nx

This monorepo is built using Next.js with the Nx workspace concept, allowing for a structured and efficient development environment. The repository consists of two projects: poc and poc2, each serving a specific purpose within the application.


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve poc or poc2 or poc3`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Shared Components
The repository includes a shared components directory that houses reusable components utilized across multiple projects. 

These components promote code reusability and consistency throughout the application.

## Features
Component Reusability: Shared components allow for the reuse of UI elements and functionalities across various projects.

Efficient Development: Nx workspace enables seamless project management and dependency sharing within the monorepo.

Modular Architecture: Projects are structured in a modular format, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
